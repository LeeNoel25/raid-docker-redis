# Multi-Region E-Commerce Platform Architecture

A multi-region, highly available and scalable e-commerce platform designed for heavy loads with automatic scaling, load balancing, and disaster recovery capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

This solution implements a modern microservices architecture on AWS, designed to handle high-traffic e-commerce workloads with enterprise-grade reliability and performance. The platform leverages containerized applications, managed services, and serverless computing to provide optimal scalability and cost efficiency.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Singapore primary with Sydney disaster recovery
- **Auto Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment with 99.99% uptime SLA
- **Microservices Architecture**: Containerized applications using ECS Fargate
- **Real-time Processing**: Event-driven architecture with Lambda
- **Advanced Security**: WAF, DDoS protection, and comprehensive monitoring
- **AI/ML Integration**: Personalization, search, and fraud detection capabilities

## Architecture Components

### 1. DNS & Edge Services
- **Route 53**: Global DNS management with health checks and failover routing
- **CloudFront**: Global CDN with edge caching for optimal performance
- **AWS WAF**: Web application firewall protecting against common threats
- **AWS Shield**: DDoS protection for all public-facing resources
- **Certificate Manager**: Free SSL/TLS certificates with automatic renewal

### 2. Authentication & Load Balancing
- **Amazon Cognito**: Scalable user authentication and authorization service
- **Application Load Balancer**: Layer 7 load balancing with SSL termination
  - Web-facing ALB for frontend traffic distribution

### 3. Compute Services
- **ECS Fargate - Web Tier**: 5 frontend services with auto-scaling
  - Configuration: 0.5 vCPU, 1GB RAM per task
  - Average 4 tasks per service for redundancy
- **ECS Fargate - Application Tier**: 8 backend microservices
  - Configuration: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM per task
  - Average 3 tasks per service with horizontal scaling
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions for event processing and auxiliary tasks

### 4. API & Integration Services
- **API Gateway**: Centralized API management with throttling and caching
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Event routing for decoupled microservices communication
- **Amazon SQS**: Message queuing for asynchronous processing
- **Amazon SNS**: Push notifications and pub/sub messaging for real-time alerts
- **Amazon MSK**: Managed Kafka for real-time data streaming

### 5. Data Storage
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage with intelligent tiering for cost optimization
- **Amazon RDS**: Multi-AZ PostgreSQL/MySQL with read replicas for high availability
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for session data and product catalogs
- **Cross-region replication**: Automated backup and disaster recovery

### 6. Caching Layer
- **ElastiCache Redis - Web Tier**: Session caching and page fragments
- **ElastiCache Redis - App Tier**: Database query caching and business logic cache
- **Multi-AZ deployment**: Ensures cache availability during failures

### 7. AI/ML & Analytics
- **Amazon OpenSearch**: Full-text search, log analytics, and business intelligence
- **Amazon Personalize**: Real-time product recommendations and personalization
- **Amazon Fraud Detector**: ML-powered fraud detection and risk assessment

### 8. Monitoring & Security
- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting
- **AWS X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for performance optimization
- **AWS Config**: Configuration compliance and change tracking
- **Amazon Macie**: Data classification and security assessment

### 9. Disaster Recovery & Backup
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Multi-region data protection and recovery
- **RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour**: Enterprise-grade recovery objectives
